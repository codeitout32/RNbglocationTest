      <strong>MODIFICATION TO TERMS OF SERVICE</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within the limits of applicable law, Your NFT Hub reserves the right to
      review and change this Agreement at any time. You are responsible for
      regularly reviewing these terms and conditions. Continued use and browsing
      of the Website after such changes shall constitute your consent to such
      changes.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications
      from Your NFT Hub (e.g. via email or by posting notices to the Service).
    </p>
    <p>
      These communications may include notices about your Account (e.g. password
      changes and other transactional information) and are part of your
      relationship with Your NFT Hub.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other
      communications that Your NFT Hub sends to you electronically shall satisfy
      any legal communication requirements, including, but not limited to, that
      such communications be in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your NFT Hub may also send you promotional communications via email,
      including, but not limited to, newsletters, special offers, surveys and
      other news and information we think will be of interest to you. You may
      opt out of receiving these promotional emails at any time by following the
      unsubscribe instructions provided therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that the ownership of digital assets (NFTs) made available
      or purchased on the Website may give you the right to view, store,
      exchange, sell and display the NFT publicly but does not allow or imply
      commercial use or ownership of intellectual property on the brand, design,
      music, video, art or other media displayed in your digital asset NFTs,
      unless specifically stated otherwise.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Assumption of Risk</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>You accept and acknowledge:</p>
    <p>
      The value of an NFTs is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to
      volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also
      materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You acknowledge that you fully
      understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
      distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those
      ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively
      impact the potential utility of NFTs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible
      tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new
      regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of
      the Service and the utility of NFTs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to
      your transactions. Your NFT Hub is not responsible for determining the
      taxes that apply to your NFTs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content
      created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but
      not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled
      items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart
      contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You
      represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making
      any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any
      NFTs or accounts/collections.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and
      we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be
      integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public
      blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and
      Your NFT Hub has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based
      products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with
      hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious
      software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
      unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and
      acknowledge that Your NFT Hub will not be responsible for any
      communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may
      experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however
      caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are
      unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or
      vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers
      and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and
      conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms
      and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable
      for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will
      suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your NFT Hub reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items
      affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may
      become inaccessible on Your NFT Hub. Under no circumstances shall the
      inability to view items on Your NFT Hub or an inability to use the Service
      in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on
      any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against Your NFT Hub.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS,
      DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING
      OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS
      RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR
      OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO
      INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR
      AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.

    <h2>
      <strong>DISCLAIMERS</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Except as expressly provided to the contrary in writing by Your NFT Hub,
      the Service and content contained therein, and crypto assets listed
      therein are provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as
      available&rdquo; basis without warranties or conditions of any kind,
      either express or implied.
    </p>
    <p>Your NFT Hub makes no warranty that the Service:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>a) will meet your requirements;</li>
      <li>b) will be available on an uninterrupted and timely basis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Your NFT Hub disclaims all other warranties or conditions, express or
      implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions
      of merchantability, fitness for particular purpose, title and
      non-infringement to the Service, as well to the content published therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Your NFT Hub attempts to make your access to and use of the service
      and content safe, you accept the inherent security risks of providing
      information and dealing online over the internet and will not hold Your
      NFT Hub responsible for any breach of security unless it is due to our
      gross negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your NFT Hub shall not be responsible or liable to you for any loss and
      take no responsibility for, and shall not be liable to you for any use of
      crypto assets, including but not limited to any losses, damages or claims
      arising from:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        a) User error, such as forgotten passwords, incorrectly contruced
        transactions, or mistyped addresses;
      </li>
      <li>b) Server failure or data loss;</li>
      <li>c) Corrupted wallet files;</li>
      <li>d) Unauthorized access to applications;</li>
      <li>
        e) Any unauthorized third party activities; including, without
        limitation, the use of viruses, phishing, brute forcing, or other means
        of attack against the service or crypto assets.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Crypto assets are intangible digital assets. They exist only by virtue of
      the ownership record maintained in a blockchain. Any transfer of title
      that might occur in any unique digital asset occurs on the decentralized
      ledger within the blockchain. Your NFT Hub does not guarantee that Your
      NFT Hub can effect the transfer of title or right in any crypto assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Your NFT Hub requests its users who register as creators to
      warrant that the crypto assets they mint as NFTs and list through Your NFT
      Hub are their own individual creations, which have not previously been
      published and/or exploited in any manner, in order for them to comply with
      these Terms, under liability to Your NFT Hub and other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your NFT Hub is not responsible for sustained casualties due to
      vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g.,
      wallet, smart contract), blockchains or any other features of crypto
      assets. Your NFT Hub is not responsible for casualties due to late report
      by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with
      the blockchain supporting crypto assets including forks, technical node
      issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability of either party
      for fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation of laws,
      or any other activity that cannot be limited or excluded by legitimate
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties in
      contracts with consumers, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

      <strong>ASSUMPTION OF RISKS</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>You accept and acknowledge:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        a) The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations
        in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely
        affect the crypto assets, which may also be subject to significant price
        volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of crypto assets
        will not lose money.
      </li>
      <li>
        b) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply
        to your crypto assets transactions. Your NFT Hub is not responsible for
        determining the taxes that apply to crypto assets transactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        c) There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency,
        including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and
        Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and
        the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
        information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that
        Your NFT Hub shall not be responsible for any communication failures,
        disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using
        the crypto assets, however caused.
      </li>
      <li>
        d) A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
        distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those
        ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively
        impact the potential utility or value of crypto assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        e) The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
        cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or
        policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service
        and the utility of crypto assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        f) There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content,
        including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets,
        mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets
        on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable.
        Your NFT Hub reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and
        assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you
        purchase may become inaccessible on Your NFT Hub. Under no circumstances
        shall the inability to view your assets on Your NFT Hub serve as grounds
        for a claim against Your NFT Hub.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      <strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall Your NFT Hub be
      liable to you or any third party for any lost profit or any indirect,
      consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising
      from these terms, the Service, or for any damages related to loss of
      revenue, loss of profit, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of
      use, loss of goodwill, or loss of data, and whether caused by tort
      (including negligence), breach of contract, or otherwise.

      and you shall be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system
      or mobile device or loss of data resulting therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
      shall the maximum aggregate liability of Your NFT Hub arising out of or in
      any way related to these terms, the access to and use of the service,
      content, crypto assets, or any products or services purchased on the
      service exceed the greater of:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        a) the amount received by Your NFT Hub from the sale of crypto assets
        that are the subject of the claim, and
      </li>
      <li>
        b) the operational costs from the sale of crypto assets that are the
        subject of the claim.
      </li>

    <p>
      The foregoing limitations of liability shall not apply to liability of
      Your NFT Hub for:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        a) death or personal injury caused by a member of Your NFT Hub&rsquo;s
        negligence; or for
      </li>
      <li>
        b) any injury caused by a member of Your NFT Hub&rsquo;s fraud or
        fraudulent misrepresentation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental
      or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not
      apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of
      liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation
      may not apply to personal injury claims.
    </p>

      <strong>TERMINATION</strong>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right,

      access or use the Service at any time and for any or no reason, and you
      acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you
      in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts
      that you have already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted by
      applicable law.

      <strong>SEVERABILITY</strong>

    <p>
      If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or
      unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision shall be severable from

      clause or provision of these Terms.
